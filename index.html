                    I currently work as a full-time, full-stack Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin and am the Scrum Master of my team.
                    I graduated from Elizabethtown College with two Bachelor's degrees, Computer Engineering and Computer Science, with a staggering cumulative GPA of 3.90.
                    I am currently working towards a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Computing Systems from Georgia Institute of Technology and expect to graduate in Spring 2024.
                    Aside from academics, my hobbies include powerlifting, basketball, video games, tasting unique foods, and brewing beer.</p>
