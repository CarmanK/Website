                    I graduated from Elizabethtown College with two Bachelor's degrees, Computer Engineering and Computer Science, and managed to graduate with the highest Latin honor, Summa cum laude, with a staggering cumulative GPA of 3.90.
                    I miss college, but at the same time, I absolutely love my job at Lockheed Martin. I have learned an incredible amount in my short time here and have quickly become a crucial member of my project.
                    After an interesting gap year due to the virus, I am now looking to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Computing Systems.
                    Aside from academics, my hobbies include playing basketball, tasting unique foods, woodworking, and more recently, brewing beer.</p>
